# Z5omes | A Zome Maker

<b>Z5omes</b> allows you to create 3D models for free.
You can now create your models with 'GoodKarma', 'Beleved' or 'Xpansion' assembly method.
You can export 3d models them in 'GLTF', 'OBJ', 'STL' (mm unit, inverted YZ) or 'PLY' formats.

To make your own Zome, please check the online app [here](https://florianwns.github.io/z5omes/).

## The Project

This project was designed to be free and will never be charged for. 
However, you have the right to [offer me a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/z5omes) ‚òï if you want to help me in my approach.

üôè I would first like to thank [Tim Hutton](https://github.com/timhutton/) from whom I took inspiration 
for the trigonometry calculations ‚óÅ and who allowed me to launch this project. üöÄ

While I wasn't a big fan originally and need to check what he writes, 
ü§ñ ChatGPT has helped me a lot with understanding vector calculations and the intersection of planes.

Sylvain Huet from [La tani√®re √† m√©m√©](https://www.domegeodesique-yourte.com/) called me one day 
to create a 3D model with the "GoodKarma" method. 
<br>Thanks to his knowledge, we were able to improve the app.

You can now to print the dimensions of the timbers, print origami stuffs, etc...

I hope this app will help zome lovers to build their dream cabin/house. üè†

Have fun and don't hesitate to share the creation of your Zome.<br>
And if you have any requests/questions, see any bugs, ‚úç feel free to write an issue.

üåü


## üåé Translations

I prefered use an homemade version of i18n, to make the app faster and lighter.

So if you want add a new language to Z5omes, 
you can copy the [i18n/en.js](i18n/en.js) file and modify the new file.

Please, fork the project, commit your changes and pull a new request. üôè

## üôè Thanks To :

This project would never have been possible without the valuable support of a few people. 
So, I would like to say a big thank you üôè

> * [Tim Hutton](https://github.com/timhutton/) whose github project inspired me for trigonometry and zome envelop calculation.
> * [Dims Zomes](http://www.rusticdomes.com/software.html) who allowed me to check my data.
> * [La tani√®re √† m√©m√©](https://www.domegeodesique-yourte.com/) for sharing knowledge particularly on the GoodKarma understanding.
> * Every donors and members of the 'Zomes' community



## ‚ö° Powered by :

Most of the calculations were written in the code.
However, for visualization as well as for the functional side within javascript,
I relied on several libraries.

> * [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) : The awesome JS toolbox. üß∞
> * [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) : For 3D vizualisation.
> * [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) : A very good minimal framework for composing behavior directly in HTML.
> * [Flag-Icons](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons) : For flag languages
